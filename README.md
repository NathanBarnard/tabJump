A Chrome extension that allows you to quickly navigate between your browser tabs using proportional keyboard shortcuts.

## Installation

### From the Chrome Web Store
1. Go to the [tabJump page on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/your-extension-id).
2. Click "Add to Chrome."
3. Confirm the installation in the pop-up window.

### Manually (For Developers)

2. Enable "Developer mode."
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select this folder.

## Usage

With **tabJump**, you can quickly jump to any tab in your Chrome browser using proportional keyboard shortcuts. The shortcut keys work as follows:

- **Ctrl+Shift+1** will take you to the **first tab** in the current window.
- **Ctrl+Shift+2** will take you to approximately **33%** of the way through your tabs
- **Ctrl+Shift+3** will take you to approximately **66%** of the way through your tabs
- **Ctrl+Shift+4** will take you to the **last tab** in the current window.

This allows for quick and intuitive navigation between your open tabs, even with many tabs open, by using relative positions rather than fixed index numbers.
